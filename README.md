Paper can be seen here [https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11399](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11399)

## Introduction
This codebase is created to build benchmarks for object detection in aerial images.
It is modified from [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).
The master branch works with **PyTorch 1.1** or higher. If you would like to use PyTorch 0.4.1,
please checkout to the [pytorch-0.4.1](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/pytorch-0.4.1) branch.
